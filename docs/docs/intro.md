# Intro

Let's discover **NumerBay in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

NumerBay is the Numerai community marketplace funded by the Numerai Council of Elders. Anything related to the Numerai tournaments can be traded directly without middleman.

Data scientists can trade their Numerai tournament submissions and artifacts for NMRs. Non-tournament participants can stake on others' predictions by buying on NumerBay and setting up auto-submission.
