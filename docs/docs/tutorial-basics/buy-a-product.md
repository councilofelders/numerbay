## Checkout and payment

### Select option and quantity
Select your preferred **product option** and the **quantity** of that product option you would like to buy, then click the **buy** button.

![Product Quantity](/img/tutorial/productQuantity.png)

:::info

The **quantity** selected here is the amount of the product option selected (which may bundle more than 1 tournament round) rather than the number of tournament rounds.

E.g. buying 3 of `2 x files for 4 NMR` option will result in an order of `3 x 2 = 6` tournament rounds totaling `3 x 4 = 12` NMRs.

:::

### Checkout
In the checkout page, confirm your order details and click **Pay**.

### Auto-submission
If the product you are buying is a tournament submission, you can select a model slot to auto-submit to.


### Payment
You will be directed to the payment confirmation page. You can leave this page if you want to. Head over to your [Numerai wallet](https://numer.ai/wallet) to make payment.

:::caution

Payment needs to be made **in full** and **in one single transaction** from your **Numerai wallet** within **30 minutes** after order creation. If no matching payment transaction is found within the time limit, the order will expire.

## Submission
If you made your order with auto-submission set up during checkout, submissions will be automatically done for you after tournament round open and after the seller submits their files.

If you did not designate auto-submission lot or auto-submission failed, you can trigger a submission from the artifact list.
