## Set up Numerai API Key

After signing up and logging in, head to the [NumerBay account](https://numerbay.ai/my-account) page for the **[Numerai API form](https://numerbay.ai/my-account/numerai-api)** under the Account sidebar section.

If you don't have a Numerai API key yet, you can create one in the [Numerai Account Settings](https://numer.ai/account) page. Make sure it has at least **View user info** permission. NumerBay only uses user info for model ownership verification and email notifications.

Additional API permissions may be needed depending on what you want to do on NumerBay, you can always change API keys later:
